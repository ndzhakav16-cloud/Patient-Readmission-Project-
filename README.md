# Hospital Patient Readmission Project
- Analyze the patient readmission dataset and present meaningful insights to the Hospital Head Doctor.
- To ensure optimal patient care and reduce unnecessary readmissions, hospitals must understand key patterns across demographics, admission types, and medical indicators.

# Problem Statement
- The hospital management aims to reduce patient readmission rates and improve operational performance, but currently lacks data-driven insights into:
  * Which factors contribute most to patient readmissions
  * How demographics (age, gender, etc.) influence length of stay and risk
  * Which departments or admission types have the highest readmission rates
  * How to identify high-risk patients early for proactive care interventions

# Aim
- The aim of this project is to analyze patient, clinical, and operational data to identify trends, risk factors, and performance patterns that contribute to hospital readmissions and overall patient outcomes.
  
# Objectives
- To identify key factors influencing readmissions (e.g., demographics, diagnosis count, length of stay)
- To analyze patient engagement and outcomes across departments and admission types
- To uncover patterns in clinical indicators such as blood pressure and sugar levels
- To provide data-driven recommendations for reducing readmissions and improving efficiency

# Tech Tools Used
- Tool	Purpose
  *SQL - Data extraction, querying, and transformation
  *Excel - Data cleaning and exploratory analysis
  *Google Looker Studio - Interactive dashboard creation
  *Miro - Process mapping and planning
  *PowerPoint	Presentation - for insights and recommendations
  
# Summary of Report
- The analysis highlights:
  * The most critical risk factors contributing to readmissions
  * Demographic and clinical trends influencing patient outcomes
  * Key hospital performance metrics such as average length of stay and departmental readmission rates

- Insights from this project enable hospital management to:
  * Develop targeted interventions for high-risk patients
  * Improve resource allocation and discharge processes
  * Enhance data-driven decision-making to improve care delivery
 
# Recommendations
- Implement post-discharge monitoring for high-risk patients
- Use predictive models to identify patients likely to be readmitted
- Improve discharge summaries and follow-up scheduling
- Regularly review departmental LOS performance for process optimization
