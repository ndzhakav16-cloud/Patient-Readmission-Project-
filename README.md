# Hospital Patient Readmission Project

Analyze the patient readmission dataset and present meaningful insights to the Hospital Head Doctor.

# Introduction

This project analyzes a hospital patient readmission dataset to uncover meaningful insights that will support the Head Doctor in improving patient care and reducing avoidable readmissions. To provide optimal healthcare, hospitals must understand key patterns across demographics, admission types, and clinical indicators.

# Problem Statement

- Hospital management aims to reduce patient readmission rates and improve operational performance. However, they currently lack data-driven insights into:
* Which factors contribute most to patient readmissions
* How demographics (age, gender, etc.) influence length of stay and risk
* Which departments or admission types show higher readmission trends
* How to identify high-risk patients early for proactive interventions

# Aim
-The aim of this project is to analyze patient, clinical, and operational data to identify trends, risk factors, and performance patterns that drive hospital readmissions and affect overall patient outcomes.
  
# Objectives

* Identify key factors influencing readmissions (e.g., demographics, number of diagnoses, length of stay)
* Analyze patient outcomes across departments and admission types.
* Uncover patterns in clinical indicators such as blood pressure and blood sugar levels.
* Provide data-driven recommendations to reduce readmissions and improve hospital efficiency

# Summary of Report
- The analysis highlights:
  * The most critical risk factors contributing to readmissions
  * Demographic and clinical trends influencing patient outcomes
  * Key hospital performance metrics such as average length of stay and departmental readmission rates

- Insights from this project enable hospital management to:
  * Develop targeted interventions for high-risk patients
  * Improve resource allocation and discharge processes
  * Enhance data-driven decision-making to improve care delivery
 
# Recommendations
- Implement post-discharge monitoring for high-risk patients
- Use predictive models to identify patients likely to be readmitted
- Improve discharge summaries and follow-up scheduling
- Regularly review departmental LOS performance for process optimization
